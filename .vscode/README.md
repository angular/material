# Visual Studio Code Configuration

This folder contains opt-out [Workspace Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)
and [Extension recommendations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_workspace-recommended-extensions)
that the Angular team recommends.

## Installation

To use the configuration follow the steps below:

- To show the recommended extensions, select "Extensions: Show recommended extensions"
  in the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).
- Install the recommended extensions of [extensions.json](extensions.json)
- Restart the editor

## Editing `.vscode/settings.json`

If you want to add additional configuration items, please note that any configuration you
add here will be used by many users.

Try to restrict these settings to things that help ease the development process and
avoid altering the user workflow whenever possible.
