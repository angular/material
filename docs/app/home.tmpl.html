      <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#introduction-goals">Material Design</a> is a specification for a unified system of visual, motion, and interaction design that adapts across different devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The material design project for Angular is a complementary effort to the <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer</a> project's <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/paper-elements.html">paper elements</a> collection. Our goal is to provide a set of AngularJS-native UI elements that implement the material design system. This demo is a work in progress.
