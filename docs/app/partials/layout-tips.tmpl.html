  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>
    The Angular Material Layout system uses the current
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/">Flexbox</a> feature set. More importantly, it also
    adds syntactic sugar to allow developers to easily and quickly add Responsive features to HTML
    containers and elements.
  </p>

  <p>
    As you use the Layout features, you may encounter scenarios where the layouts do not render as
    expected; especially with IE 10 and 11 browsers. There may also be cases where you need to add
    custom HTML, CSS and Javascript to achieve your desired results.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below, you will find solutions to some of the more common scenarios and problems that may arise
    when using Material's Layout system.
  </p>

  <h3>General</h3>

  <p>
    The following are some general guidelines and tips when using the flex and Layout attributes
    within your own applications.
  </p>

  <ul class="spaced">
    <li>
      When building your application's Layout, it is usually best to start with a mobile version
      that looks and works correctly, and then apply styling for larger devices using the
      <code>flex-gt-*</code> or <code>hide-gt-*</code> attributes. This approach typically leads
      to less frustration than starting big and attempting to fix issues on smaller devices.
    </li>

    <li>
      Some elements like <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> do not always
      work correctly with flex. Additionally, some of the Angular Material components provide their
      own styles. If you are having difficulty with a specific element/component, but not
      others, try applying the flex attributes to a parent or child <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> of the
      element instead.
    </li>

    <li>
      Some Flexbox properties such as <code>flex-direction</code> can not be animated.
    </li>

    <li>
      Flexbox can behave differently on different browsers. You should test as many as possible on
      a regular basis so that you can catch and fix layout issues more quickly.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Chrome Flex Height</h3>

  <p>
    In Flexbox, some browsers will determine size of the flex containers based on the size of their
    content. This is particularly noticable if you have a non-flex item (say a toolbar), followed by
    two flex items in a column layout.
  </p>

  <docs-demo demo-title="Chrome Flex Height - Odd" class="small-demo colorNested">
    <demo-file name="index.html">
      <div layout="column" style="height: 450px !important;">
        <div style="height: 50px;">Toolbar</div>

        <div flex layout="column" style="overflow: auto;">
          <md-content flex layout-margin>
            <p>Flex with smaller content...</p>

            <p ng-repeat="i in [0,1,2,3,4]">Line {{i}}</p>
          </md-content>

          <md-content flex layout-margin>
            <p>
              Flex with larger content...
            </p>

            <p ng-repeat="i in [0,1,2,3,4]">Line {{i}}</p>

            <div id="toHide">
              <p ng-repeat="i in [5,6,7,8,9]">Line {{i}}</p>
            </div>
          </md-content>
        </div>
      </div>
    </demo-file>
  </docs-demo>

  <p>
    Notice how in Chrome the second scrollable area is nearly twice as tall as the first. This is
    because we are using nested flex items and the contents of the second
    <code>&lt;md-content&gt;</code> are twice as large as the first. Try clicking the button below
    to toggle the light blue box; this will make the containers the same size.
  </p>

  <p layout="row" layout-align="center center">
    <md-button class="md-raised" ng-click="tips.toggleContentSize()">
      {{tips.toggleButtonText}} Blue Box
    </md-button>
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to fix this, we must specify the height of the outer flex item. The easiest way to
    achieve this is to simply set the height to <code>100%</code>. When paired with the
    <code>flex</code> attribute, this achieves the desired result.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>
      <strong>Note:</strong> When <code>height: 100%</code> is used without the <code>flex</code>
      attribute, the container will take up as much space as available and squish the toolbar which
      has been set to a height of <code>50px</code>.
    </em>
  </p>

    <demo-file name="index.html">
      <div layout="column" style="height: 450px !important;">
        <div style="height: 50px;">Toolbar</div>

        <div flex layout="column" style="overflow: auto; height: 100%;">
          <md-content flex layout-margin>
            <p>Flex with smaller content...</p>

            <p ng-repeat="i in [0,1,2,3,4]">Line {{i}}</p>
          </md-content>

          <md-content flex layout-margin>
            <p>
              Flex with larger content...
            </p>

            <p ng-repeat="i in [0,1,2,3,4]">Line {{i}}</p>

            <div>

  <h3>Firefox <code>md-content</code> Height Calculation</h3>

  <p>
    Firefox currently has an issue calculating the proper height of flex containers whose children
    are flex, but have more content than can properly fit within the container.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is particularly problematic if the flex children are <code>md-content</code> components as
    it will prevent the content from scrolling correctly, instead scrolling the entire body.
  </p>

  <div class="md-whiteframe-3dp">
    <iframe height='376' scrolling='no'
            src='//codepen.io/team/AngularMaterial/embed/NxKBwW/?height=376&theme-id=0&default-tab=result'
            frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>
      See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/team/AngularMaterial/pen/NxKBwW/'>Angular Material Basic App</a>
      by Angular Material (<a href='http://codepen.io/AngularMaterial'>@AngularMaterial</a>)
      on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
    </iframe>
  </div>

  <p>
    Notice in the above Codepen how we must set <code>overflow: auto</code> on the div with the
    <code>change-my-css</code> class in order for Firefox to properly calculate the height and
    shrink to the available space.
  </p>

</div>
