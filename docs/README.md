Documentation
-------------

The AngularJS Material **Live Docs** are generated from the source code. In fact, the AngularJS Material documentation itself uses the AngularJS Material layout, components and themes.

> Our build process uses **[dgeni](https://github.com/angular/dgeni)**, the wonderful documentation
generator built by [Pete Bacon Darwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin).

To view the Live Docs (locally):

1. Install the dependencies using `npm install`
1. Build the docs and serve with 'live reload' using `npm run watch`
1. Open Browser for [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
