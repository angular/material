Documentation
-------------

The Angular Material **Live Docs** are generated from the source code and demos; and, in fact, the
Live Docs actually use the Angular Material components and themes.

> Our build process uses **[dgeni](https://github.com/angular/dgeni)**, the wonderful documentation
generator built by [Pete Bacon Darwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin).

To view the Live Docs (locally):

1. Install the dependencies using `npm install`
1. Build the docs using `gulp docs`
1. Run `gulp watch site --dev` to serve and live reload the docs
1. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
