### Component Templates

This folder and its contents provide a starting template for any Angular Material component.  It is easy to use these assets for your own custom component development.

> Please do all of your development work in a Git branch; labelled with a WIP prefix!!

Simply:

-  Create a work-in-progress Git branch;
-  Clone this directory to the `/src/components/`
-  Rename all files from `_name_*.js` with the name of your component;
> e.g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gridlist.js, &nbsp;&nbsp; select.js
-  Rename **jsDoc** ** references to `_name_`
-  Rename **source** references to `_name_`
