## Understanding the Team Commit Process
The AngularJS Material team has a very specific process for change commits.

Our commit process is intentionally restrictive to 
1. Support the evolution of AngularJS Material while avoiding unexpected breaking changes
1. Manage change complexity and coding standards within the library

AngularJS Material uses a "Pull Request" process to allow team leads opportunities to maintain
code reviews, ensure sanity checks, encourage coding standards, and provide feedback to help
contributors learn and improve.

#### General Rules

* Please **do not** commit directly to master; unless explicitly authorized by a Team Lead
* Contributors should fork the repository and work on fixes or enhancements on their own fork.
  * Use the Pull Request feature to submit your changes to the 'origin' AngularJS Material repository
* When a developer has changes ready for merging into master, those fixes or updates must be submitted via a Pull Request
* All PRs should be rebased (with master) and commits squashed prior to the final merge process
* Please include unit tests with all your source (component or core) changes
* All unit tests must be 100% passing before the PR will be approved/merged.

#### Commit Authorization Rules

The development team has defined three (3) Github levels of **commit authorization** within 
[AngularJS Material](https://github.com/angular/material/):
