# Material Design for AngularJS Apps [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/angular/material.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/angular/material)

=======

[Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/) is a specification for a unified system of visual, motion, and interaction design that adapts across different devices.

Our goal is to deliver a lean, lightweight set of AngularJS-native UI elements that implement the material design system for use in Angular SPAs.

This project is still in early preview. It is a complementary effort to the [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/) project's [paper elements collection](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/paper-elements.html).

> Please note that using Angular Material requires the use of **Angular 1.3.x** or higher. These components are intended to work in the latest version of "evergreen" browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari). 

## Demo Site

You can see these components in action at http://material.angularjs.org.

Or you run build the docs and demos locally. See the [Documentation README](https://github.com/angular/material/tree/master/docs) for details.

## Development

This project is in early development via a small core team of [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) developers. We don't have guidelines yet for broader community involvement, although we hope to have some soon.

For issues, including progress on accessibility support for these UI elements, see the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/angular/material/issues).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/angular/material/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information
on structure, documentation, and code conventions.

## Usage

In its current early state, use AngularJS Material Design at your own risk.  APIs are changing rapidly.

If you wish to use angular-material anyway, you can:

a. `bower install angular-material` to the get latest stable release (or download the files directly from the [bower-material repository](https://github.com/angular/bower-material)).

b. `bower install angular-material#master` to get the version just committed to master (less stable than a release).

View the [README in the bower-material repository](https://github.com/angular/bower-material/tree/master/README.md) for how to get started.

### File Structure

- Components belong in `src/components/{componentName}`
- Component modules must be named `material.components.{componentName}`
- Templates for directives are declared inline
- Gulp builds files to `dist` folder, which is not version controlled (read below)

### Commit Conventions

- http://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog
- git commit-msg hook available [here](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/validate-commit-msg.js).  Place it in `.git/hooks/commit-msg`, and run `chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg`. It will validate your commit messages for you.

### Development

- `npm install` for gulp deps
- `git submodule update --init` to add icons subfolder
- `bower install` for angular deps
- `gulp build` (alias `gulp`) to build, add `--release` flag to uglify & strip console.log.
- `gulp watch` to build & rebuild on changes
- `gulp validate` to test and jshint
- `gulp jshint` to run jshint
- `gulp karma` to test once
- `gulp karma-watch` to test & watch for changes
- `gulp docs` to build docs into dist/docs

### Documentation

- See `docs/README.md`.
