Subheaders are special list tiles that delineate distinct sections of a list or grid list and are typically related to the current filtering or sorting criteria. Subheader tiles are either displayed inline with tiles or can be associated with content, for example, in an adjacent column. Upon scrolling, subheaders remain pinned to the top of the screen and remain pinned until pushed on or off screen by the next subheader. @see [Material Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/subheaders.html)

> To improve the visual grouping of content, use the system color for your subheaders.
